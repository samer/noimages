# Installation
## From the XPI
I have prepackaged a release for easy installation.
1. Download the XPI file from the [releases](https://github.com/samer/noimages/releases) page.
2. Open the file with Firefox

## From source
1. Install the [Mozilla Addon SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation)
2. Clone this repo
3. `cd` into the repo
4. run `cfx xpi`
5. open `noimages.xpi` in Firefox

# Usage
By default No Images adds an icon to your toolbar. You can move the icon to the hamburger menu by clicking on the menu then choosing "customize".

Note that unblocking images reload the currently active tab.
